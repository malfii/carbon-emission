    "---\n",
    "In this notebook, we will do exploratory data analysis for the data we have gathered. Our workbook starts with some brief information about how we collected collected the data from this project and the data dictionary. After doing the preliminary EDA, we will take a detailed look at the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) score trends over time. This is done by looking at the trend of CPI for some of the countries to figure out whether there are some other indicators that show similar trend to CPI. We then focused our EDA to features that show a higher correlation with CPI. We then conclude the notebook with a brief look at some of the less correlated features. More work with the data and cleaning is done during our data cleaning process. \n"

    "## Data Gathering and Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the problem statement, the main goal of this study is to investigate corruption perception in different countries over time and see whether we can find some information to model corruption (Corruption Perception Index (CPI) was used for this purpose). The data gathering process for this project started by doing some research and brainstorming about the features that could be related or be an indicator of the corruption in a country. After identifying the factors that are important, we started our data gathering process by searching over all the available resources in the Internet to gather information about the identified target features. In that process, we focused our search towards data from credible sources and institutions that have data available for at least past 30 years. After collecting data from all of the sources, we started merging process by doing outer merge, with an emphasize on countries and years that have CPI data (as our target variable) available. All the collected information is saved into a metadata and used for our EDA and modeling. The following table shows the features we have collected, a long with a description of that feature and the source of information. \n"

    "**Why is it important to know corruption, investigate it, and inform the public about it?** Corruption hinders economic growth by increasing costs, lowering productivity, discouraging investment, reducing confidence in public institutions, limiting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, weakening systems of public financial management, and undermining investments in health and education. Corruption can also increase poverty by slowing economic growth, skewing government expenditure in favor of the rich and well-connected, concentrating public investment in unproductive projects, promoting a more regressive tax system, siphoning funds away from essential public services, adding a higher level of risk to the investment decisions of low-income individuals, and reinforcing patterns of unequal asset ownership, thereby limiting the ability of the poor to borrow and increase their income (source: mcc.gov).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the costs of corruption?** Political costs by affecting freedom and rule of law, social costs by impacting peoples participation and trust in government, and economic cost by impacting the opportunities to build and grow, by deteriorating the trust in the country and affecting the future possible investment and growth opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) is a score introduced by Transparency International to measure how corrupt each country’s public sector is perceived to be, according to experts and businesspeople (source: Transparency International). In the latest releases of the CPI, the index is calculated on a 0 to 100 basis scale in which higher scores means the countries have done a good job controlling corruption. According to the Transparency International, each country’s score is a combination of at least 3 data sources drawn from 13 different corruption surveys and assessments. These data sources are collected by a variety of reputable institutions, including the World Bank and the World Economic Forum.\n"

    "From the map, we can see clear trends in countries and where they are located. North American countries (except Mexico) scored pretty high for CPI. On the other hand, the Central American countries are seen to have done a poor job in corruption control. The CPI score in South America is not the highest but shows definitive improvements compared to Central America. On the other side of the world, the European countries show a high CPI score while the farther we move to east, the score tends to decrease. The score distribution in Africa is relatively low while some southern African countries are able to score high CPI. Asian countries also show a mix distribution in which the far eastern Asians score relatively good but countries in the middle east and the vicinity do not perform well.  "

As will be shown later, there are some features in our database that show strong correlation with CPI (specifically features about worldwide governance indicators) but for this part of the analysis, we will pick up some features that are more obvious to observe in every society and the day to day life of people (daily income, regulatory quality, democracy, and gender inequality).

Another observation for Bahrain is that the democracy index is also decreasing with time but other factors increase over time, and it seems difficult to draw any conclusion on what factor could be a good representative of what could happen with CPI over time.
